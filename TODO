Make it work on:
Windows 8
Windows 8.1
PC-BSD
Solaris


. If we can find a way to get the Windows kernel version, add a kernel field 
	to each OS.
. Figure out how to include service pack info in Windows
. If release is always a version number like 11.01.3. Then return it as 
	a tuple (11, 01, 3)

The we can do things like this:
if os_release < (8, 03):
	print("Blah version 8.03 or greater is required. Exiting ...")
	exit(1)
