py-osinfo
=========

Get the OS type, brand, and release with Python.

Py-osinfo should work without any extra programs or libraries, beyond 
what your OS provides. It does not require any compilation(C/C++, assembly, 
et cetera) to use. The goal is for this to work on every OS that Python 
supports.
